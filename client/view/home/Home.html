	<p>
		The book of Revelation has fascinated, mystified, and terrified Christians for hundreds of years. Dr. Phil Kayser's Revelation Project seeks to clear away the smoke and present the book as John's original audience would have understood it. The 1st-century Christians John wrote to knew that most of the events prophesied in Revelation would take place within their lifetime (between 66-73 AD) John filled the book with prophetic symbols about Rome, Jerusalem, and the times in which they lived — symbols from their common cultural background which he knew they would understand. Phil makes these symbols understandable once again, as he draws from Old Testament symbology, first-century historical works, ancient near-east archaeology, and over 100 biblical commentaries. After studying Revelation for over thirty years, examining the best of every school of interpretation, Phil unfolds Revelation not as an end-times-guide, but as a hope-filled practical manual on spiritual warfare, worship, prayer, perseverance in trial, resistance to tyranny, God's preservation of the church, and Jesus' victory over all of his enemies.

	<p>
		The first fourteen sermons are useful as a primer on hermeneutics in their own right. Phil unpacks the interpretive principles buried in the first chapter of Revelation which explain the rest of the book.
	</p>
	<h3>The project</h3>
	<p>
		Pastor Phil Kayser has been studying Revelation for over 30 years.  Starting in May 2015, he began a sermon series studying it verse by verse.  The sermon series was concluded in December 2018.
	</p>
	<p>
		Besides sermons, Biblical Blueprints is also publishing study guides, explanations, and visualizations to make the book clearer to modern readers, and give historical context for the events described in the book.
	</p>
	<h3>Sermons</h3>
	<p>
		The full text and audio of every sermon is available <StateLink state="main.sermons">here</StateLink>.
	</p>
	<p>
		We also have a podcast feed - find it in your podcast app by searching for "Revelation Project: Sermons".
	</p>
	<h3>Historical timeline</h3>
	<p>
		Pastor Kayser is compiling a historical timeline of the events described in Revelation, and they are available in a visual <StateLink state="main.timeline">timeline</StateLink>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The timeline is still in a very early stage in terms of data and usability.  We will update it over time to make it easier to navigate, tweak dates and add more events as research continues, and add more detailed descriptions of the events with links to the verses describing them.
	</p>
	<h3>
		The majority text, in its chiastic structure
	</h3>
	<p>
		Revelation has more textual critical issues (and thus translational differences) than any other book of the Bible. Rather than constantly discussing the technical issues of textual criticism and reasons why we differ from various translations, we chose to use Wilbur Pickering’s translation of Revelation. It is based on family 35 of the Byzantine tradition, which Pastor Kayser considers the best representative of the Ecclesiastical Text.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is this translation that is <StateLink state="main.structure.text">displayed here</StateLink>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The text is laid out in the <StateLink state="main.structure.explanation" anchor="the-pattern">chiastic structure</StateLink> identified by Pastor Kayser instead of by chapter number, making it easier to read.
	</p>
	<p>
		Sermon text and audio recordings are aligned next to the relevant verses.
	</p>
	<h3>
		More to come
	</h3>
	<p>
		With adequate funding and time, there are many resources we plan to make available, including:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Relevant passages from secular historians such as Josephus linked alongside verse text and timeline events
		</li>
		<li>
			Symbology cheatsheets (e.g. "white horse = Emperor Tiberius")
		</li>
		<li>
			Symbology references (e.g., all other places in the Bible referencing "Babylon")
		</li>
		<li>
			Detailed technical notes on individual verses
		</li>
	</ul>
